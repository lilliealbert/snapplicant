## Snapplicator

An app + bookmarklet to make managing job applications more organized and pleasant.

I'm keeping myself organized using Pivotal Tracker. Feel free to take a peek at my plans: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/871565.

I'm using Postgresql for development and production, so having that installed will help if you want to play around with the app locally.
